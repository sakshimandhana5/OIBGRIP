        <p>Lata Mangeshkar (born as Hema Mangeshkar; 28 September 1929 â€“ 6 February 2022) was an Indian playback singer and occasional 
            music composer. 
            She was widely considered to have been one of the greatest and most influential singers in India. 
            Her contribution to the Indian music industry in a career spanning seven decades gained her 
            honorific titles such as the "Queen of Melody", "Nightingale of India", and "Voice of the Millennium".
            Lata Mangeshkar recorded songs in over thirty-six Indian languages and a few foreign languages, though primarily in Hindi,
            Bengali, Marathi. She also sang in English, Russian, Dutch, and even Swahili. 
            She received several accolades and honors throughout her career. In 1989 the Dadasaheb Phalke Award was bestowed on 
            her by the Government of India. In 2001, in recognition of her contributions to the nation, she was awarded the Bharat Ratna, 
            India's highest civilian honour; she is only the second female singer, after M. S. Subbulakshmi, to receive this honour. 
            France conferred on her its highest civilian award, Officer of the National Order of the Legion of Honour, in 2007.
            Her last recorded song was "Saugandh Mujhe Is Mitti ki" released on 30 March 2019 as a tribute to the Indian Army and Nation.
            At one point, she appeared in the Guinness World Records which listed her as the most recorded artist in history between 1948 and 1987.</p>
